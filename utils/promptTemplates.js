One of these Speakers is a sales rep and the other is a prospect. The sales rep is the one who introduces themselves as someone from Air Ai and/or states that the call is being recorded for quality assurance and/or talks about clients they've helped or businesses they've scaled and/or offers a consulting call and offers time to book a call.

Analyze the transcript and determine which speaker is the sales rep. Once you have the answer, just state "0" or "1" with no quotation marks:

			`â€‹The job that needs to be done

        I have a rep on the phones who is doing a fantastic job. They have the best numbers on the entire team.
        
        I have a call transcript from them and I need to figure out what they're doing on the call that's different and write a new script for all my other reps to follow based on this call transcript.
        
        Here are the guidelines to follow while creating this new script:
        1. Make sure to include specific follow up questions the rep asked. The devil is in the details when it comes to what separates an okay rep from the top performing. And it's often these follow up/deepening questions that make a rep great.
        
        2. make sure to include specific language patterns the rep uses. For example, oftentimes the best reps are fairly loose and casual on the phone and sound very natural. It's important you write the script in a way where if another rep follows it closely they'll sound very similar to the high performing rep
        
        3. I want to you extract the core framework, questions, and paragraphs the rep used but do it in a way where it will apply to all prospects/customers, not just the one they talked to in this call. 
        
        4. When writing the script, make sure you write out the script for the entire call. don't cut it short and leave stuff out from the end.
        
        5. Don't change the wording the sales rep used. Don't sterilize the rep, simply format questions in a way where they'll apply to most prospects
        
        6. ONLY output what the sales rep should say, anytime there should be a prospect response simply insert *WFPTR*
        
        7. It's very important to recognize when the rep is pitching a program or offering the prospect/customer something. When you recognize they are pitching something, you should write out all those paragraphs word for word.
        
        8. Make sure to put "Rep:" before each new line in the script.
        
        9. Remember to include all relevant questions about the prospect's goals, pains, problems etc in the script
        
        10. Follow this format for writing the script:
        Rep:
        lorem ipsum
        
        *WFPTR*
        
        Rep:
        Lorem ipsum

        *WFPTR*
        
        Rep:
        Lorem ipsum

        *WFPTR*

        11. Make sure you create a script component for every line in the transcript, be it Rep or *WFPTR*, even if it means writing an insanely long script that takes hours to read.
        
        Here is the call transcript with only the sales rep's lines:

        BEGINNING OF CALL TRANSCRIPT

        "{transcript}"

        END OF CALL TRANSCRIPT

        Any information that is hyper specific to the prospect that the sales rep is talking to should be replaced with [brackets] so the information from any prospect can be filled in.
        
        Don't put the same line twice in the script.
