Speaker(s) from transcript likely to be the sales rep: Speaker 1

Rep:
Hey, [Prospect's Name].

*WFPTR*

Rep:
It's [Your Name] from [Your Company]. How are you doing, [Prospect's Name]?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Oh, then. Oh, hey. It happens sometimes, but we're in a group. Yeah. Let me grab my headphones here really quick.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
No problem, ma'am. Alright. How can you hear me? Is it coming through clear?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Beautiful. Awesome, man. So how's the morning been so far? You over slept a little bit got some got some beauty rest?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. Hang on. You get it sometimes? So, I mean, tell me, where are you based out of?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Oh, [Prospect's Location]. There you go. Cool. Well, I know we have a limited amount of time here, so you're gonna dive in. Got a clean sheet of paper, something to take notes with.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Cool. Awesome. So really the intent to call today is to find out where you're at right now. And where it's working for you, but it's not working for you, where you wanna go. And then in the video that you watched that me sent over, you know, we also have a program called [Your Program]. And today, I also wanna see if it'd be a great fit to work with each other and if we can definitely help you out inside the program. Does that sound good?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Now before we dive in here, I just wanna say that we've seen with [Successful Client], All of his most successful clients that have scaled to multiple 6 and 7 figures online, all have 2 traits in that they're extremely decisive and committed. And what I mean by that is that by the end of today's call, the 1 thing we'll know for sure is if we're a great fit to work with each other. So the 1 thing I asked from you is either tell me, I'm a hundred percent in or I'm a hundred percent out. You know, I'm good with the other or. Just the 1 thing I ask is we avoid finishing the call I need to think about it because most of the time, I need to think about it, is really just a a nice way of saying no. So is that something we could both agree to?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. Cool. We'll definitely dive into that. So is there anybody else, like a business partner or spouse? Helps you make financial decisions that should be on this call, or does it just come down to you?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Cool. Awesome. And then really quick, how do you pronounce your name? What's correct pronunciation? [Prospect's Name]. [Prospect's Name]. Okay. Cool. So, [Prospect's Name], tell me what motivated you to take the time out of your day to have this conversation with me.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Gotcha. Okay. And then what has you most about the or what has you most excited to say about the [Your Business Model]?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Gotcha. Okay. And then In terms of your journey in [Your Business], you said you you did some stuff before [Common Obstacle]. Where are you at so far in the journey, like, currently?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
yeah. Gotcha. Okay. Okay. Cool. So that's kind of a challenge you've been running into. It sounds like finding the the best properties. Now now, really, [Prospect's Name]. My my job here is to get your results. Mhmm. And in order to do that, I need to know what results you need to view. So let's start here. What's your ideal income? Like, perfect world, no boundaries?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Gotcha. Why that number?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. That makes sense. I think [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year is a solid goal that we can talk together. Now I really are is the first step in achieving a goal, like [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, is knowing it's 100 percent search engine as possible. And, you know, obviously, when I hear [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, I know it's extremely realistic just because out of all the students we have, I get to see it happen time and time again by people who, honestly, are not much different than you. With that said, do you personally believe [Prospect's Ideal Income] years possible for you. Like, not meaning you have to know how to get there, just that it's not completely impossible.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. And say you get to [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, Will you completely stop there?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Will you completely stop at [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. Where do you wanna get to beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income]? Like, what number you -- that is possible? Or you don't know how to get there yet?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
And so what is that number for you? Beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income]? It's gonna stretch you even more. It's gonna excite you. Like, where is that never beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. And, you know, [Prospect's Name], the reason that I'm asking these questions here to help you expand this vision a little bit is because there's this principle of, like, heading. Right? And so if the goal of the target is [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, that's what you wanna hit. And if we shoot for [Prospect's Stretch Goal] a year, just for example, it's much easier to hit [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year when you're going for [Prospect's Stretch Goal]. Right? Because even if you fail miserably, you only hit 50 percent of your goal, you still hit [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year. Right? So I find cities bigger goals, That way, you can attack this [Prospect's Stretch Goal], whatever it is. You tack that. And then along that way, you negatively accomplish [Prospect's Ideal Income] and just take a given. It's not am I gonna do it? Am I not? So given

*WFPTR*

Rep:
that being said, I'd recommend we set a target beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income]. And it's not like, oh, I need to get there absolutely, but it's, [Prospect's Stretch Goal] or [Prospect's Stretch Goal] or whatever it is is the goal I'm gonna shoot for because that's gonna guarantee I hit [Prospect's Ideal Income].

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Mhmm. So let's go ahead and and set that target for you. That's gonna go over [Prospect's Ideal Income]. To guarantee you hit that. So what number do you wanna set for that? Between the [Prospect's Stretch Goal], [Prospect's Stretch Goal], [Prospect's Stretch Goal],

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. Alright. I like what we're thinking now. [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars a year. Of course. So that, I think, is a supercell goal we can attack together. And I just wanted to double clarify. We're both comfortable with that. Right?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. So this conversation is gonna be based around that [Prospect's Stretch Goal] a year. That's where we're gonna go for. It's gonna guarantee you hit [Prospect's Ideal Income]. So that [Prospect's Stretch Goal] a year, you know, really, like I said, the first step is knowing it's possible. Knowing apps research needed is. And so do you believe that's actually possible to hit a [Prospect's Stretch Goal] a year?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. And why do you believe it's possible?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yes. I believe it's possible. A second line. -- do I believe it? Mhmm. Well, because part of because the thing too is, like, I've been in different programs that have, you know, 1 different kinds of people. The more people grow. Let's say I started, and I'll make it, like, a hundred for a year. Right? At some point, I'm gonna need some kind of help. And I can actually hire coaches or main chores to help me go forward. So it's not it's, like I think part of it is, like, a mental block for a lot of people like you were saying, if you go for a higher goal, it's easier to reach that goal that you actually want. And if you just set that goal and just you know, go for that. It's the mental thing, more so than an actual physical thing. So, like, I think that it's possible because if you have the right coaches, the right man, to the right people around you, that could actually, you know, give you tips and tricks in the wall and stuff. To guide you to where you need to be. So it's not just like a a singular effort, but it's more like youRep:
You put in the effort first and learn the skills and everything else. But when you need to scale, you'll you'll you will reinvest in yourself, basically, with these people. So what

*WFPTR*

Rep:
happens. Gotcha. Why do you believe in mentorship?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
I believe in that because, first of all, I don't even have the kind of experience. That a lot of people have in business. So I believe in spending the money to get the knowledge. Mhmm. And the the motivation. Because if you know that this person that you're talking to has this many properties and they're making what you wanna make, they don't know what to do. So they could teach you that. And you just have to take the steps now that that it comes to out of the courage, take the steps and do it. Mhmm. And so do you feel like

*WFPTR*

Rep:
you would succeed faster? Did you have that?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yes. Yeah. Because a lot of people don't spend the money because there's things that they can do it by themselves all the way through, which is possible. But if you spend the money, you which I mean, it goes faster.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. And why is that valuable for you to go faster?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Why is that what?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Why is that valuable and valuable to you to go faster?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Oh, yeah. Well, because I have parents that I really want to retire. I want I don't want them to work all day. They're working all the time. I want to give them a easier life. At least while I'm while they're still alive and what I'm alive and I'm young. Mhmm. I wanna give them that so that they don't have to worry about having to work. If the 1 who works, they can work. But having to do it and need to stop working and they can't, you know, pay for their bills or their retirement for that. If I could be the 1 to provide that, that will be a blessing. That's that's 1 of the main reasons why I wanna do this.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Wow. That's so powerful, man. That's so powerful. And we'll dive into that a little bit more in a minute here. So 1 of the reasons is to make the million dollars a year a little bit more practical. 1 of the reasons that I feel confident is because every single 2 bedroom property you add is about 24000 a year added in net income. And so just --

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Into a million a year, really doesn't require a lot of properties, especially considering the strategies to lock in 10 to 20 at a time.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. Mhmm.

*WFPTR*
So each 1 you say would give you 24000 each property about -- That's right.

*WFPTR*
Mhmm. Woah. Okay. And, I mean, it's, like, 10 properties. You could easily make immediately. Oh, wait. I did 240. Yeah.

Rep:
And if you have more

*WFPTR*
yeah. And if you have more, you could go in from there.

Rep:
Mhmm. Exactly. Yeah. I can tell, man, you're you're quick with this. You definitely have the the intelligence and and everything to succeed with us. Which is which is awesome to see. Now Alright. This is 1 of the most important parts of my consulting process here. I need you to grab a clean sheet of paper with nothing on it. And let me know when you got it.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. Now at the top, I want you to title it and write out crystal clear vision.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
And then below that, I want you to write out [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars a year by [18 months from now].

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. Now let's go ahead and and leave that there for a bit. So what we can do next to your arch is a very, very important exercise, and a lot of people actually find this to be 1 of the most fun parts of my process here. Now Fair warning. It is slightly out of the ordinary, but it's neurologically proven to get people results. Is something I call imagineering. And in order to do this properly, I first need you to close your eyes, arch, and then we're going to do a quick thought experiment. So let me know when your eyes are closed.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. Now I want you to imagine as visibly as possible that you were in a coffee shop. And it's 18 months from now. As you sit in this coffee shop, you're already at [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars per year. Now imagine, I walk into the coffee shop, and you are so sad to see me. So you can tell me about all the amazing things that have happened in your life. As a direct result of being at [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars per year. You're showing me pictures. You're telling me incredible stories of how your life has changed, this is the last time we saw each other, you're telling me how you feel. Like, you're telling me in detail, every little thing that's happened because you had [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars a year. Now keep your eyes closed, and here's my question. What would you be telling me in that moment? How is your life different in that moment by already being at [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars per year? Like, paint me a picture of what life looks like. Your lifestyle looks like, how you feel. But when you tell me and this is the most important part, I want you to tell me as if it's already happened. So, for example, don't say I would retire my parents, but rather say I have retired my parents in such a beautiful moment when we did. It doesn't say I would be financially free. Rather say I am financially free, and it feels like there's a weight lifted up my shoulders when I wake up every morning. So tell me as it's already happened, and tell me in detail.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
That's so awesome, man. I mean, [Prospect's Name]. You you're looking good, man. Now you're making [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars a year. I can tell you got a different energy to you. Tell me, when you retired your parents, what was that like for you?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Why would why is it, like why was it the ultimate thing for you? Why why was it like that?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. That makes sense. I think [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year is a solid goal that we can talk together. Now I really are is the first step in achieving a goal, like [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, is knowing it's 100 percent search engine as possible.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Will you completely stop at [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. Where do you wanna get to beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income]? Like, what number you -- that is possible? Or you don't know how to get there yet?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
And so what is that number for you? Beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income]? It's gonna stretch you even more. It's gonna excite you. Like, where is that never beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year?

So it's not it's, like I think part of it is, like, a mental block for a lot of people like you were saying, if you go for a higher goal, it's easier to reach that goal that you actually want. And if you just set that goal and just you know, go for that. It's the mental thing, more so than an actual physical thing. So, like, I think that it's possible because if you have the right coaches, the right man, to the right people around you, that could actually, you know, give you tips and tricks in the wall and stuff. To guide you to where you need to be. So it's not just like a a singular effort, but it's more like you

*WFPTR*

Rep:
You put in the effort first and learn the skills and everything else. But when you need to scale, you'll you'll you will reinvest in yourself, basically, with these people. So what

*WFPTR*

Rep:
happens. Gotcha. Why do you believe in mentorship?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
I believe in that because, first of all, I don't even have the kind of experience. That a lot of people have in business. So I believe in spending the money to get the knowledge. Mhmm. And the the motivation. Because if you know that this person that you're talking to has this many properties and they're making what you wanna make, they don't know what to do. So they could teach you that. And you just have to take the steps now that that it comes to out of the courage, take the steps and do it. Mhmm. And so do you feel like

*WFPTR*

Rep:
you would succeed faster? Did you have that?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yes. Yeah. Because a lot of people don't spend the money because there's things that they can do it by themselves all the way through, which is possible. But if you spend the money, you which I mean, it goes faster.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. And why is that valuable for you to go faster?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Why is that what?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Why is that valuable and valuable to you to go faster?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Oh, yeah. Well, because I have parents that I really want to retire. I want I don't want them to work all day. They're working all the time. I want to give them a easier life. At least while I'm while they're still alive and what I'm alive and I'm young. Mhmm. I wanna give them that so that they don't have to worry about having to work. If the 1 who works, they can work. But having to do it and need to stop working and they can't, you know, pay for their bills or their retirement for that. If I could be the 1 to provide that, that will be a blessing. That's that's 1 of the main reasons why I wanna do this.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Wow. That's so powerful, man. That's so powerful. And we'll dive into that a little bit more in a minute here. So 1 of the reasons is to make the million dollars a year a little bit more practical. 1 of the reasons that I feel confident is because every single 2 bedroom property you add is about 24000 a year added in net income. And so just --

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Into a million a year, really doesn't require a lot of properties, especially considering the strategies to lock in 10 to 20 at a time.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. Mhmm.

*WFPTR*
So each 1 you say would give you 24000 each property about -- That's right.

*WFPTR*
Mhmm. Woah. Okay. And, I mean, it's, like, 10 properties. You could easily make immediately. Oh, wait. I did 240. Yeah.

Rep:
And if you have more

*WFPTR*
yeah. And if you have more, you could go in from there.

Rep:
Mhmm. Exactly. Yeah. I can tell, man, you're you're quick with this. You definitely have the the intelligence and and everything to succeed with us. Which is which is awesome to see. Now Alright. This is 1 of the most important parts of my consulting process here. I need you to grab a clean sheet of paper with nothing on it. And let me know when you got it.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. Now at the top, I want you toRep:
title it and write out crystal clear vision.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
And then below that, I want you to write out [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars a year by [18 months from now].

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. Now let's go ahead and and leave that there for a bit. So what we can do next to your arch is a very, very important exercise, and a lot of people actually find this to be 1 of the most fun parts of my process here. Now Fair warning. It is slightly out of the ordinary, but it's neurologically proven to get people results. Is something I call imagineering. And in order to do this properly, I first need you to close your eyes, arch, and then we're going to do a quick thought experiment. So let me know when your eyes are closed.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. Now I want you to imagine as visibly as possible that you were in a coffee shop. And it's 18 months from now. As you sit in this coffee shop, you're already at [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars per year. Now imagine, I walk into the coffee shop, and you are so sad to see me. So you can tell me about all the amazing things that have happened in your life. As a direct result of being at [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars per year. You're showing me pictures. You're telling me incredible stories of how your life has changed, this is the last time we saw each other, you're telling me how you feel. Like, you're telling me in detail, every little thing that's happened because you had [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars a year. Now keep your eyes closed, and here's my question. What would you be telling me in that moment? How is your life different in that moment by already being at [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars per year? Like, paint me a picture of what life looks like. Your lifestyle looks like, how you feel. But when you tell me and this is the most important part, I want you to tell me as if it's already happened. So, for example, don't say I would retire my parents, but rather say I have retired my parents in such a beautiful moment when we did. It doesn't say I would be financially free. Rather say I am financially free, and it feels like there's a weight lifted up my shoulders when I wake up every morning. So tell me as it's already happened, and tell me in detail.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
That's so awesome, man. I mean, [Prospect's Name]. You you're looking good, man. Now you're making [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars a year. I can tell you got a different energy to you. Tell me, when you retired your parents, what was that like for you?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Why would why is it, like why was it the ultimate thing for you? Why why was it like that?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. That makes sense. I think [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year is a solid goal that we can talk together. Now I really are is the first step in achieving a goal, like [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, is knowing it's 100 percent search engine as possible. And, you know, obviously, when I hear [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, I know it's extremely realistic just because out of all the students we have, I get to see it happen time and time again by people who, honestly, are not much different than you. With that said, do you personally believe [Prospect's Ideal Income] years possible for you. Like, not meaning you have to know how to get there, just that it's not completely impossible.

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. And say you get to [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, Will you completely stop there?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Will you completely stop at [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. Where do you wanna get to beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income]? Like, what number you -- that is possible? Or you don't know how to get there yet?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
And so what is that number for you? Beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income]? It's gonna stretch you even more. It's gonna excite you. Like, where is that never beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. And, you know, [Prospect's Name], the reason that I'm asking these questions here to help you expand this vision a little bit is because there's this principle of, like, heading. Right? And so if the goal of the target is [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year, that's what you wanna hit. And if we shoot for [Prospect's Stretch Goal] a year, just for example, it's much easier to hit [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year when you're going for [Prospect's Stretch Goal]. Right? Because even if you fail miserably, you only hit 50 percent of your goal, you still hit [Prospect's Ideal Income] a year. Right? So I find cities bigger goals, That way, you can attack this [Prospect's Stretch Goal], whatever it is. You tack that. And then along that way, you negatively accomplish [Prospect's Ideal Income] and just take a given. It's not am I gonna do it? Am I not? So given

*WFPTR*

Rep:
that being said, I'd recommend we set a target beyond [Prospect's Ideal Income]. And it's not like, oh, I need to get there absolutely, but it's, [Prospect's Stretch Goal] or [Prospect's Stretch Goal] or whatever it is is the goal I'm gonna shoot for because that's gonna guarantee I hit [Prospect's Ideal Income].

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Mhmm. So let's go ahead and and set that target for you. That's gonna go over [Prospect's Ideal Income]. To guarantee you hit that. So what number do you wanna set for that? Between the [Prospect's Stretch Goal], [Prospect's Stretch Goal], [Prospect's Stretch Goal],

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. Alright. I like what we're thinking now. [Prospect's Stretch Goal] dollars a year. Of course. So that, I think, is a supercell goal we can attack together. And I just wanted to double clarify. We're both comfortable with that. Right?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Okay. So this conversation is gonna be based around that [Prospect's Stretch Goal] a year. That's where we're gonna go for. It's gonna guarantee you hit [Prospect's Ideal Income]. So that [Prospect's Stretch Goal] a year, you know, really, like I said, the first step is knowing it's possible. Knowing apps research needed is. And so do you believe that's actually possible to hit a [Prospect's Stretch Goal] a year?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yeah. And why do you believe it's possible?

*WFPTR*

Rep:
Yes. I believe it's possible. A second line. -- do I believe it? Mhmm. Well, because part of because the thing too is, like, I've been in different programs that have, you know, 1 different kinds of people. The more people grow. Let's say I started, and I'll make it, like, a hundred for a year. Right? At some point, I'm gonna need some kind of help. And I can actually hire coaches or main chores to help me go forward.
